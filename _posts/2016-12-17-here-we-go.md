Yet another dev blog? Yup, seems so. I created it to share tweaks, hacks, fixes and tips I experience during development.
The blog is based on Jekyll static code generator and the Bulma.io CSS framework. I really
liked to work with Bulma due to its lightweight and its SASS base, which plays well
with Jekylls Ruby base.

My goal is to provide some shortcuts through the valley of pain we all face during development.

If any comments pop up, I'll try to answer every single one.
